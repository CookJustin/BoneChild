Bone Child Roadmap

1. Foundations & Technical Infrastructure
Save/Meta-progression System:
Implement persistent data for meta-progression (milk, unlocks, story flags).
Dialogue & Narrative System:
Create a flexible system for displaying narration, dialogue, and environmental storytelling.
Cutscene/Scripted Event System:
Allow for in-game scripted events (e.g., awakening, boss intros, transformations).

2. ACT 0 — AWAKENING (Tutorial/First Run)
Scene 0.1: Bone Pile
Black screen, heartbeat, fade-in, first movement/attack tutorial.
Minimal UI, cryptic narration.
Scene 0.2: The Whisper
Implement sigil visual and ghostly voice.
Short, optional dialogue system.

3. ACT I — UNDERWORLD STAGES
Procedural Stage Generation:
3–5 unique stage motifs (Marrow Fields, Ash Nursery, etc.).
Each stage = a failed attempt at becoming human.
Enemy/Fragment System:
Enemies drop fragments for temporary upgrades.
Visual feedback for Bonechild’s physical changes (limbs, cracks, etc.).
Environmental Storytelling:
Place visual cues and lore objects in levels.

4. ACT II — UNDERWORLD BOSS
Boss Design & Implementation:
Design and code at least one boss (Collector, Midwife, Hollow Knight).
Integrate boss defeat cutscene and sigil transition.

5. ACT III — SURFACE STAGES
Surface Level Generation:
New tilesets, hostile environment, and unique enemies.
Surface Rejection Mechanic:
Implement mechanics showing Bonechild doesn’t belong (e.g., environmental damage, hostile animals).
Environmental Storytelling:
Add craftsman/milk imagery, effigies, and clues.

6. ACT IV — GEPETTO, THE MAKER
Final Boss Design:
Multi-phase fight, constructs, forced debuffs/transformations.
Visuals: workshop, milk tubes, etc.
Narrative Integration:
Dialogue and cutscenes for Gepetto’s philosophy.

7. ACT V — THE MILK (META-PROGRESSION)
Meta-progression Unlocks:
Implement upgrades: flesh overlays, new abilities, clearer voice, etc.
Visual and mechanical feedback for each meta-progression step.

8. ACT VI — THE LOOP CONTINUES
Loop & Replayability:
On death, return to underworld with new dialogue, NPCs, and paths.
Track and unlock new content across runs.

9. ENDGAME & EXPANSION
True Ending & Choices:
Allow for reaching the surface without a sigil.
Implement final choice: remain new or become “real.”
Dynamic changes to Gepetto and world across runs.

Things to Consider
Narrative Integration:
Tie story beats to gameplay progression (not just cutscenes).
Visual Feedback:
Show Bonechild’s transformation visually and mechanically.
Replayability:
Ensure each run feels meaningful (new dialogue, paths, abilities).
Accessibility:
Allow for skipping cutscenes, readable fonts, colorblind options.
Testing:
Playtest each act for pacing, difficulty, and narrative clarity.
